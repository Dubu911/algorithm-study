# Shortest Path in a Binary Matrix with Obstacles

# You are given an m x n grid of 0s and 1s, where 0 is an empty cell and 1 is an obstacle. 
# You start at (0,0) and want to reach (m-1, n-1).

# You can move up, down, left, or right to an empty cell. 
# Return the minimum number of steps needed, or -1 if it is impossible.

# Example

# grid =
# [[0,0,1],
#  [0,0,0],
#  [1,0,0]]


# One shortest path uses 4 steps → answer 4.
